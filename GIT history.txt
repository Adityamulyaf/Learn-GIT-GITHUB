The HIstory of Git

1. 2002-2005: The Beginning
- The Linux kernel project initially used BitKeeper, a proprietary version control system
- BitKeeper provided free use to the Linux development community
- In 2005, the relationship between Linux community and BitKeeper broke down when free use was withdrawn

2. Birth of Git (2005)
- Created by Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux)
- Development started in April 2005
- Main goals:
  * Speed
  * Simple design
  * Strong support for non-linear development
  * Fully distributed
  * Able to handle large projects like Linux efficiently

3. Development & Growth
- Initial development took only a few days
- By June 2005, Linux kernel was managed using Git
- Junio Hamano became the lead maintainer in July 2005
- First version (0.99.9n) released in July 2005

4. Rise to Popularity (2007-2010)
- Many major projects began adopting Git
- GitHub launched in 2008, making Git more accessible
- Growing popularity in open-source communities
- Companies started migrating to Git from SVN and other VCS

5. Modern Era (2010-Present)
- Became the most widely used version control system
- Standard for software development
- Major platforms supporting Git:
  * GitHub
  * GitLab
  * Bitbucket
- Used by both small projects and large enterprises

6. Key Innovations
- Distributed version control
- Branching and merging model
- Speed and efficiency
- Data integrity through SHA-1 hashes
